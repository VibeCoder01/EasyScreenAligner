# Easy Screen Aligner
Vibe Coded, runs in Powershell on Windows 11, not tested on anything else.
Compiled to an .exe with PS2EXE.

If you have say three screens on your Windows setup but they are at different heights and orientations then it can be a little tricky to get them nicely lined up so the mouse pointer glides from one screen to another without jumping up or down a couple of inches.  Easy Screen Aligner makes this easy by drawing a red line across all your screens, which you drag up or down until all the lines are level. Click a tick on each screen to confirm the changes then the script will adjust the screens to ensure near perfect alignment.

USE WITH CAUTION:- This is **vibecoded** and although the functionality has been checked the code itself has not.
