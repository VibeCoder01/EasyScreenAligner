If you have say three screens on your Windows setup but they are at different heights and orientations then it can be a little tricky to get them nicely lined up so the mouse pointer glides from one screen to another without jumping up or down a couple of inches.  Easy Screen Aligner makes this easy by drawing a red line across all your screens, which you drag up or down on each screen until all the lines are level. Click a tick on each screen to confirm the changes then the script will adjust the screens to ensure near perfect alignment.

USE WITH CAUTION:- This is **vibecoded** and although the functionality has been checked the code itself has not.
